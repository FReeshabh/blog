class="c2">&nbsp;Labyrinth Escape VR is a two-player maze puzzle explorer game. One player is the maze runner who traverses the maze in a VR world. The other player is a teammate with a navigational map that helps the maze runner escape the labyrinth using hints and clues that the navigator gets using his information map. This two-person puzzle brings a new look to escape games everywhere. This game is not designed to take a long time to complete but instead focuses on teamwork and improving critical thinking. We expect players to take no longer than 10-20 minutes to complete the game using our current design. </span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7 c20 c22">Purpose for project:</span></p><ul class="c13 lst-kix_eehvn8zcq7p7-0 start"><li class="c1 c21 c16"><span class="c0">Audience </span></li></ul><p class="c1 c18"><span class="c2">Our target audience mainly focuses on Children.This can also be played between a child and a parent. We recommend that the parent always plays as the navigator. We believe our game will help stimulate and improve a child&#39;s intellectual capacity. Not only do we want to focus on a child&rsquo;s ability to improve their education but teach them team work as well. In doing this we are attempting to steer away from typical single player based games and create a VR environment that has been specifically designed for two players to help improve the intellectual capacity of the players as well as help them discover how important teamwork is in not only the game but real life.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><ul class="c13 lst-kix_eehvn8zcq7p7-0"><li class="c1 c21 c16"><span class="c0">Education</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c6"><span>Riddles have been used to &ldquo;work [a person&#39;s] brain&rdquo; </span><span class="c11 c4">(</span><span class="c4 c26">Justin Zablocki</span><span class="c11 c4">)</span><span>. Using riddles stimulates a person&rsquo;s intellectual capacity and makes them work with critical thinking and problem solving. Riddles also can help improve &ldquo;</span><span class="c4 c9">r</span><span class="c4 c9">eading comprehension&rdquo; and &ldquo;vocabulary&rdquo; </span><span class="c4 c11">(</span><span class="c26 c4">Justin Zablocki</span><span class="c11 c4">)</span><span class="c4 c9">. Riddles accomplish this by making players use context clues and critically reading to allow them to solve the problem. In this game, we are focusing on an easier set of problems to allow us to develop and create this interactive two player environment. However, we could easily increase the difficulty of the intersection riddles to create a more rigorous course to be used by adults or previous players who want more of a challenge.</span></p><p class="c1 c16 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><ul class="c13 lst-kix_eehvn8zcq7p7-0"><li class="c1 c21 c16"><span class="c0">Teamwork</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c2">Another aspect we wanted to focus on was teamwork. Our game creates a labyrinth that can only be solved if both parties work together. Though the navigator will receive the riddle or part of the riddle, the runner will be the only one able to see the intersection. This means they must work together in order to solve the puzzle and choose the next path.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><ul class="c13 lst-kix_fbgvxscbjjoz-0 start"><li class="c1 c16 c21"><span class="c0">Communication</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c2">Communication will also be key when solving the labyrinth. We added some twists to some riddles to make the runner and navigator need to communicate in order to solve a puzzle. This not only helps with problem solving but allows the two players to figure out proper communication and use it to solve each intersection.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c22 c7 c20">Initial design:</span></p><ul class="c13 lst-kix_l1fl3e55cse3-0 start"><li class="c1 c21 c16"><span class="c0">Number of Players and Type:</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c2">There is currently a minimum and maximum of two players in order to correctly solve this puzzle.

We did this for two main reasons. The first reason is that there may be a few super easy riddles with multiple correct paths in order to get the hang of the game. The second reason is so that if you do make a mistake and go down a right path and there is still a way to escape, you may still win the labyrinth. This acts more as an unseen extra life in some areas. The maze will be decorated and at each intersection, decorations, such as objects, wall art, and floor art, may give you a clue to figure out which way to proceed based on the navigator&#39;s riddle.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 198.30px; height: 170.17px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 302.54px; height: 323.77px; margin-left: -54.30px; margin-top: -30.23px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c7">Design:</span><span>&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c2 c4">When making the maze I initially created a couple of cubes to serve as the plain and the player and the walls. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c4"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c2 c4">I gradually added more walls to create the feeling of a maze.

The way we do this is to make a copy of whatever maze the algorithm generates and make it into one of our prefabs. We can then reuse this asset. I used this process to create the entire 16x16 maze and then I added tiles that corresponded to the correct answers and wear we could ask our trivia question. I highlighted colors for each path to show we had 6 possible ways a player could go. I kept iterating on this until there were plenty of alternate paths. Through a process of counting I determined a way that no matter which path the player takes, they have to answer 5 questions. There are a total of 16 yellow squares which will represent the rooms we will implement which initiate questions. Since the maze itself is kind of narrow and cramped, ideally we would want the player to get teleported to another room.</span></p><p class="c1 c6 c5"><span class="c2 c4"></span></p><p class="c1 c6 c5"><span class="c2 c4"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c2 c4">Finally I had the idea to link every since yellow square to each other through links that allow the player to jump from intersection to intersection, skipping the long and boring walking time, and this drastically improved the amount of fun I was having while running through the maze. There is a slight vertical change that really gives the player a sense that they are hopping from place to place.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 522.50px; height: 309.75px;"><img alt="" src="images/image10.png" style="width: 1314.68px; height: 554.18px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: -67.43px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c16"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><ul class="c13 lst-kix_l1fl3e55cse3-0"><li class="c1 c21 c16"><span class="c0">Map:</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c7">Description:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The map will be a minimap of the maze. However there will be fog of war in place. This means the navigator cannot see the full maze and tell the runner how to escape without using the riddles. The map will have three important components. The first component will be a side panel to the left of the map. This panel is where a riddle will appear when a player arrives at an intersection. The second component would be a green dot on the minimap that indicated the current location of the player in the maze. Finally, the third component would be a red dot that can be seen through fog of war. This red dot indicates a barbarian. Players may have to hide from a barbarian if it approaches them and there is still a way out of the labyrinth. If there is not a way out, meaning the player already lost. The barbarians will hunt him and he will not be able to hide ending the game.</span></p><p class="c1 c6 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c7">Design</span><span>: (Environment): </span><span class="c2">We are going for a sort of old school elder scrolls vibe but with modern graphics and vr as the player navigates the maze. I want the player to feel impressed and surprised as they see each room and notice how much detail was added in every scene. The walls should be brick but they also have candle lights and torches, a library and a bookcase, a fireplace, blood, skeletons, evidence of life. There should be particles, like smoke rising, sand and water falling, lighting that changes based on the temperature of the room. When the player has to answer a riddle I want the room to really have a sense of magic to it, like they actually feel like they have been transported to a strange room and that they have to answer the riddle for their life. We want to include sound effects like water dripping or a creaking noise, the sound of a screaming barbarian as he comes near. There should be unique items all over the maze that act as hints, a broken window that lets you see the other side, an escape ladder, spikes shoot out immediately after the player leaves the spot to give a thrilling sense of adventure. We are going for photo realism.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c2">A boulder running after the player as they run towards the final goal.In addition we also hope to include small minigames and intractable objects for the player immersion.</span></p><p class="c1 c5 c6"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c2">(Minimap): There will be a minimap that the player 2, the navigator, will see which displays a simplified version of the maze with a &ldquo;fog of war&rdquo; added which basically shows only what is near the player and where they&rsquo;ve been. We still need to implement this but, we are working on a script that is able to detect the next available paths in this fog of war. The visual information that the runner sees is then translated into this simplified 2D image that portrays fog of war similarly, but not exactly like, RTS games. Alternatively we can also just make the Minimap an orthographic camera. </span></p><p class="c1 c6 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><ul class="c13 lst-kix_l1fl3e55cse3-0"><li class="c1 c21 c16"><span class="c0">Barbarian</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c7">Description:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The barbarian will be the only NPC (non player character) that can actually end the players quest to beat the labyrinth. The barbarian will move randomly throughout the maze and if a player is on a correct path and a barbarian approaches the player may hide until it leaves. However, if the player is not on a correct path and there are no other ways the player may beat the labyrinth, the barbarian will then hunt the player taking direct paths, and the player will not be able to hide. This will result in the game ending.</span></p><p class="c1 c6 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c7">Design:</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c24">&hellip;.Fill this in</span></p><p class="c1 c6 c5"><span class="c2 c24"></span></p><ul class="c13 lst-kix_l1fl3e55cse3-0"><li class="c1 c21 c16"><span class="c0">Movement:</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c7">Description:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The runner will be able to move through the maze and jump from intersection to intersection allowing him to decide which path to take next based on the riddle discussion between him and the navigator.

Several scripts were created. For example on PC the uses has the choice to move with a mouse to the spot they are facing. They can also press the escape key to remove cursor lock and interact with the game&rsquo;s other options like &ldquo;free camera&rdquo; which enables them to take stalk of their environment. In VR, we hope to be able to allow the player to be able to say &ldquo;camera&rdquo; and the game automatically recognizes to stop the player from moving and look around until they are ready. </span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 341.00px; height: 120.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image8.png" style="width: 624.00px; height: 385.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c1 c6 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c2">The current UI is essentially for testing purposes but we can later include a UI similar to this but it can be gazed based.

So we have CardBoard and PC support currently but not high end VR just yet. </span></p><p class="c1 c6 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c2">I also made it to wear, instead of running to just where the player looks, they instead jump to the next intersection to save time.

For example, if the entire movement system is gaze based like we currently have it, if we create a speed variable, and get data from wireless VR controllers that one of us has, then we can get data for how fast they are waving their hands up and down. If we are able to record how fast they are moving their arms up and down then we will be able move the player faster (as if they were running).</span></p><p class="c1 c6 c5"><span class="c2 c24"></span></p><ul class="c13 lst-kix_l1fl3e55cse3-0"><li class="c1 c21 c16"><span class="c0">Intersections:</span></li></ul><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c7">Description:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Each intersection will be decorated to represent clues and answers to the riddles that the navigator will be given.

Joshua Fryar in charge of asset and riddle acquisition as well as ensuring the rules of the game are consistent as we move forward. Joshua and Saif will work hand in hand together to decorate the maze and make sure the riddles and intersections work properly. We have also put Junwoo in charge of the Barbarian. This includes figuring out the hunting/random movement of the barbarian without running through walls. Finally we have put Rishabh in charge of voice controls and the ability to use them with movement. We are all also researching and learning how to do the minimap. Since this will be a little unknown, linking two scenes like this to any other with real time update, we have decided to not assign it to one person but work on it as a whole as we research and figure it out. We should be able to accurately get the maze finished quickly and then Saif and Joshua will start on the map while Junwoo and Rishabh finish up what they are currently assigned. Then we will all work on it and begin testing. </span></p><p class="c1 c16 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p
