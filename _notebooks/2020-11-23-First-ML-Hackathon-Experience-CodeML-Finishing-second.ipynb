    "This past weekend I participated in the CodeML hackathon, which was my first machine learning hackathon experience. Given this blog post, is about a machine learning hackathon, I feel that it's quite apt to write this blog in Jupyter Notebooks. \n",

    "There were 6 challenges hosted on Kaggle, and they were:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Celestial Body Clustering\n",
    "2. Anomaly Detection\n",
    "3. Reddit comments classification\n",
    "4. Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "5. Image Classification\n",
    "6. Easy Imagenet Classification (Or as I later found out, it was not really Imagenet)\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried my hand at Challenge 5, and Challenge 6. And this blog post documents my experience with these challenges."
