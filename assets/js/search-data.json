I study Computer Science and currently I’m the acting technical lead for EWoCS (Extraordinary Women of Computer Science), so you can find me hosting one of those workshops! I’m also a student researcher under Dr. Amanda Brown for Fall 2020 working on metatranscriptome analysis. And was the marketing lead for HackWesTX 2020 (largest Hackathon in West Texas!). And through the hackathon, I managed to find myself an intern at Group Nire for the Fall 2020 session. . You might also catch me around the town doing a standup comedy routine. . If you want to find me, call on to Cthullu. If Cthullu doesn’t answer, an email is acceptable too rishabhtewari1@gmail.com .",
