            "content": "Challenges in this Hackathon . This past weekend I participated in the CodeML hackathon, which was my first machine learning hackathon experience. Given this blog post, is about a machine learning hackathon, I feel that it&#39;s quite apt to write this blog in Jupyter Notebooks. . There were 6 challenges hosted on Kaggle, and they were: . Celestial Body Clustering | Anomaly Detection | Reddit comments classification | Sentiment Analysis | Image Classification | Easy Imagenet Classification (Or as I later found out, it was not really Imagenet) | I tried my hand at Challenge 5, and Challenge 6. And this blog post documents my experience with these challenges. .",

The README file documents all the models, animations, and code snippets used. The next project for this class will use the Unity Game Engine, which is a more topical tool than Aframe for virtual reality development. .
