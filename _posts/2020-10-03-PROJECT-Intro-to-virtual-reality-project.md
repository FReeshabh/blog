# My first introduction to virtual reality
This project was my first real experience with virtual reality. This project is made to be run in a browser and can be viewed by clicking on this [link](https://freeshabh.github.io/virtual-reality-project-1/). 

This project was made for my CS 4331-5331 class, and more information about this project can be found on the project's README.md page [here](https://github.com/FReeshabh/virtual-reality-project-1#virtual-reality-project-1---rishabh-tewari).
